List of homework tasks:

19 
Create a Maven project and add Selenium dependency and dependency for Faker.
In the main class, using Selenium, go to https://demoqa.com/text-box.
The task is to fill in all the fields (Full Name, email, Current Address, Permanent Address) and click submit using Faker.
Compare whether the result (below submit) has the same full name and email as the ones entered before submitting, to check if there has been any modification. 
Write an appropriate message if the data is the same or different.

20
Test the signup page on the website https://vue-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com.
Verify that the page URL contains the route "/signup". 
Verify that the "email" input field has the attribute type set to "email" and the "password" input field has the attribute type set to "password".
Manually check negative scenarios (invalid email, short password, empty fields, etc.), and then create automated tests to verify the error messages if they are displayed.
Positive scenarios are not of interest here. It is desirable to have a minimum of 5 tests.
Use TestNG and add before and after class methods.

21
Perform the same task as for homework 20, but use the new patterns we covered in the lecture. 
It is necessary to create three separate projects and apply a different pattern in each of them.
